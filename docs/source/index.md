Welcome to Bondrewd's documentation!
====================================

**Bondrewd** is a programming language that aims to provide powerful
compile-time metaprogramming capabilities, while still being as fast as C++
when compiled. The language is inspired primarily by Python and Rust.

```{note}
At the moment, the language is under active development. Anything in this
documentation may change at any time.
