Welcome to Bondrewd's documentation!
====================================

**Bondrewd** is a programming language that aims to provide powerful
compile-time metaprogramming capabilities, while still being as fast as C++
when compiled. The language is inspired primarily by Python and Rust. The title
itself is a reference to Made in Abyss, a Japanese manga and anime series.

The source code of the project can be found on
[GitHub](https://github.com/abel1502/bondrewd).

```{note}
At the moment, the language is under active development. Anything in this
documentation may change at any time.
```

```{warning}
As a matter of fact, a lot **has** changed, and some parts of this
documentation are now outdated. Excercise caution, and refer to the
[blog](https://bondrewd.dev/blog) for more up-to-date information.
